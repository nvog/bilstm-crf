## About

This repository contains code that implements a sequential neural conditional random field (CRF) in DyNet.
It can be trained using DyNet's autobatching (on CPU or GPU) to perform sequence labeling tasks such as named-entity recognition (NER) or 
part-of-speech (POS) tagging, for which demo data is provided.
